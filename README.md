# Data Visualization Project - Master's in Data Science (UOC)

This repository contains the results of Python code used to create three types of data visualizations: a Sankey diagram, a contour plot, and a force-directed graph. These examples are part of my masterâ€™s project in Data Science at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC).

## Video Explanation
Watch a detailed explanation of the project and its visualizations in the video below:
